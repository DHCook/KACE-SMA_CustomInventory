***No longer an issue. Microsoft is no longer checking the compatibility of AV as noted here. This is only for reference.***


Microsoft identified a compatibility issue with a small number of antivirus software products.

The compatibility issue arises when antivirus applications make unsupported calls into Windows kernel memory. These calls may cause stop errors (also known as blue screen errors) that make the device unable to boot. To help prevent stop errors that are caused by incompatible antivirus applications, Microsoft is only offering the Windows security updates that were released on January 3, 2018, to devices that are running antivirus software that is from partners who have confirmed that their software is compatible with the January 2018 Windows operating system security update.

If you have not been offered the security update, you may be running incompatible antivirus software, and you should consult the software vendor.

Microsoft is working closely with antivirus software partners to ensure that all customers receive the January Windows security updates as soon as possible.

Queries three parts of the system to determine if a reboot is pending, including KACE patching. Admittedly not the prettiest script. I start with a much longer and nicer script but due to character length restrictions passing the command to the KACE agent, I had to shorten everything I could. Unfortunately, I cannot locate the original full script so the short version is all there is...

Example Output:
Reboot Pending : False 
Windows Update : False
KACE Patching  : False
Pending Rename :
